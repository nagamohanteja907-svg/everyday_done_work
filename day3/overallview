The Big Picture
You are learning about an Embedded Linux (and RTOS) system built around the Novatek NT9852x chip. Your documents cover:

The Hardware: The NT9852x SoC and its components (boot ROM, cipher engine, DSI, MIPI, etc.)

The Boot Process: How the system starts up, from power-on to a running OS.

The Operating Systems: Linux and RTOS running on the chip.

The Software Development Kits (SDKs): How to write applications for it.

The Peripherals & Drivers: Audio, video, storage, USB, etc.

Recommended Learning Path
Follow these steps to build your knowledge from the ground up.

Step 1: Foundation - Understand the Hardware and Boot Process
Before writing code, understand what you're working with. This is the most crucial step.

Start with the SoC Overview:

NT9852x_Affine_User_Guide_en.pdf - This is likely your "high-level" overview. It should explain the chip's main blocks (CPU, GPU, video encoder/decoder, ISP, etc.). Skim this first to know what the chip can do.

Understand How it Boots:

NT9852x_Boot_Rom_code_User_Guide_en.pdf - The first code that runs when power is applied. It reads the boot mode pins and looks for the first-stage bootloader. Essential.

NT9852x_Boot_Loader_User_Guide_en.pdf - This covers nvtboot (the next stage). It initializes more hardware (like DRAM) and loads the final bootloader (U-Boot) or the OS.

NT9852x_nvtboot_User_Guide_en.pdf - Dives deeper into this specific bootloader stage.

NT9852x_Secure_boot_User_Guide_en.pdf / NT9852x Secure_Boot_Flow_User_Guide_en.pdf - Explains how to cryptographically verify each stage of the boot process to prevent running malicious code. Read this after you understand the normal boot flow.

Step 2: The Development Environment - SDKs and OS Guides
Now you know how it boots, learn how to build software for it.

Choose Your OS and SDK:

For Linux: NT9852x_SDK_Linux_Programming_Guide_en.pdf - This is your master guide. It will explain how to set up the build environment, compile the kernel, root filesystem, and your applications.

For RTOS (Real-Time OS): NT9852x_SDK_RTOS_Programming_Guide_en.pdf - Use this if you're working on a low-latency, real-time application (e.g., certain audio processing tasks). You will likely need both.

NT9852x_SDK_UBoot_Programming_Guide_en.pdf - U-Boot is the powerful bootloader used before Linux starts. This guide is for customizing it.

NT9852x_SDK_OPTEE_User_Guide_en.pdf - OPTEE is a "Trusted Execution Environment" for running secure apps. This is advanced security stuff.

Step 3: Core System Components
With the basics down, dive into specific subsystems.

Memory and Storage:

NT9852x Memory Map_Linux_User_Guide_en.xls - CRITICAL. This Excel sheet shows how the physical address space is laid out (where DRAM, peripherals, SPI flash, etc., are mapped). Refer to this constantly.

NT9852x_EMMC_User_Guide_en.pdf - For eMMC storage.

NT9852x_SPI-NOR_Support_List_... & NT9852x_SPI-NAND_Support_List_... - Compatibility lists for flash chips.

NT9852x_UBI_Filesystem_User_Guide_en.pdf / Filesystem_User_Guide_en.pdf - UBI/UBIFS is the standard filesystem for raw NAND flash. Very important for embedded devices.

Linux Drivers:

NT9852x_Linux_Driver_User_Guide_en.pdf - A general guide for the Linux drivers provided by Novatek.

NT9852x_RTOS_Driver_User_Guide_en.pdf - The same, but for the RTOS side.

Step 4: Specialized Peripherals and Libraries (Pick based on your project)
You don't need to read all of these. Focus on what's relevant to your goal.

Audio:

NT9852x_Linux_AudioLib_User_Guide_en.pdf

Novatek_HDAL_Audio_Library_Usage_en.pdf

Novatek_AUDIOLIB_AAC.pdf (Audio Codec)

Novatek_AUDIOLIB_ANR.pdf (Audio Noise Reduction)

Video/Display:

NT9852x_DSI_User_Guide_en.pdf

NT9852x_Graphic_User_Guide_en.pdf

Novatek Panel_User_Guide.pdf

Novatek_MIPI-DSI_Timing_Gen_User_Guide_zh.xlsx (Note: Chinese)

Security:

NT9852x_CIPHER_API_(Security_Engine)_User_Guide_en.pdf - How to use the hardware crypto accelerator.

Connectivity:

Novatek_Host_UVC_Application_Note.pdf - How to make the device act as a USB Video Class device (like a webcam).

Novatek_RNDIS_on_Windows_10_Platform_User_Guide_zh.pdf - USB Ethernet (Note: Chinese)

Tools & Analysis:

Linux - Perf system analysis.pdf - Great for Linux performance profiling.

Storage_Devices_Analysis_Application_Note_en.pdf - Useful for benchmarking storage.

How to Approach Reading
Skim First, Deep Dive Later: Don't try to memorize everything. Get the gist of what a document contains. Bookmark it and return when you need the details.

Have a Project in Mind: The best way to learn is by doing. A simple goal like "get the SDK to build" or "make an LED blink" will force you to find and understand the relevant information.

Cross-Reference: You'll often need to jump between documents. For example, the SDK guide will tell you to configure U-Boot, which will require the U-Boot guide and the Memory Map.

Language Note: Several documents are in Chinese (_zh.pdf). Use Google Translate or another tool with OCR if you need to access them. The English versions are usually available for the most critical docs.

Suggested First Project
Goal: Build and run a basic Linux image for a reference board.

Steps:

Read the Boot ROM and Boot Loader guides to understand the initial process.

Follow the NT9852x_SDK_Linux_Programming_Guide_en.pdf to set up your PC's build environment.

Build a simple image. The SDK likely has a default configuration.

Use the NT9852x_Preburn_Image_User_Guide_en.pdf to learn how to flash this image to a device or emulator.

If you get it running, try to modify a simple application and add it to the build.
